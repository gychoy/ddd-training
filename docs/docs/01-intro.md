# Introduction

In this workshop, we’ll introduce you to Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and how it can be integrated with GraphQL. We’ll explore building a GraphQL server using ASP.NET Core 8 and Hot Chocolate, with a focus on applying DDD principles to structure your application. You’ll learn how to implement CQRS and use GraphQL to handle both commands and queries effectively. Additionally, we’ll cover tools that help you manage complex domains and schemas in a scalable way.

Technologies covered: .NET 8, ASP.NET Core 8, TypeScript, GraphQL, Hot Chocolate, CQRS, Domain-Driven Design
